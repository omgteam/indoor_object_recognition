indoor_object_recognition
=========================

Combine convolve neural network and conditional probability to categorize indoor objects.

--Abstract: Indoor object recognition is cornerstone of smart home and workplace. We took advantage of CNN(Convolve Neural Network) to imitate biology visual system, and conditional probability model to mimic our logical reasoning during object recognition. There exists spatial relation between indoor objects, for example, mouse usually lies on the right side of computer. We figured out a way to automatically build up conditional probability model by these spatial relation. And combine deep learning model with conditional probability model to achieve higher recognition accuracy. 
--Algorithms and API involved: convolve neural network, Theano, scipy, numpy, sklearn Back propagation and so on.
